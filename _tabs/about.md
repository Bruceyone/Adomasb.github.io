<h1>Hello!</h1>

I’m Ryan as you've probably already guessed! I’m from Glasgow, Scotland but currently staying in Lithuania (Labas!) but will be moving back to Scotland next year. I work full time in the logistics sector while also enrolled in The Open University (studying Computing & IT) to add to this I’ve recently just became a father to my beautiful boy Adomas. 

I’ve decided to start documenting my journey into the coding sphere of Python by setting up this blog (which in doing so was already a journey over the past few days!) and to get out of tutorial hell. In doing so, I hope it will keep me in check and possibly a resource I could fall back on for future reference. Throughout the week, I’ll try to post some daily coding challenges that I have attempted and my thoughts on them, potentially some projects too – be warned though I’m just a beginner. 

Who knows as I continue to strive for self-growth, I may even be able to help someone in a similar circumstance.
